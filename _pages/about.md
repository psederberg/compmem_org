The overarching goal of our lab is to develop a comprehensive theory of memory formation and retrieval that links our rich cognitive behavior to its underlying neural mechanisms.

Psychologists have studied many simple behavioral tasks, such as free recall, for over 100 years. These tasks reveal the complex dynamics of human memory processes as we track what participants remember correctly and, often more interestingly, what they donâ€™t. Our lab combines a number of approaches to uncover the neural correlates and develop computational models of these processes:

* We collect and perform multivariate analysis of neural data, including fMRI and EEG.
* We run large-scale behavioral experiments.
* We develop computational models to link neural activity and behavior and to guide our experimental work.
* If you would like more information about the lab, our research, and members, please follow the links at the top of the page.
