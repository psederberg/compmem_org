	Abstract = {Eye movements are an important data source in vision science. However,
	the vast majority of eye movement studies ignore sequential information
	in the data and utilize only first-order statistics. Here, we present
	a novel application of a temporal-difference learning algorithm to
	construct a scanpath successor representation (SR; P. Dayan, 1993)
	that captures statistical regularities in temporally extended eye
	movement sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scanpath
	SR on eye movement data from participants solving items from Raven's
	Advanced Progressive Matrices Test. Analysis of the SRs revealed
	individual differences in scanning patterns captured by two principal
	components that predicted individual Raven scores much better than
	existing methods. These scanpath SR components were highly interpretable
	and provided new insight into the role of strategic processing on
	the Raven test. The success of the scanpath SR in terms of prediction
	and interpretability suggests that this method could prove useful
	in a much broader context.},

	Abstract = {Recent work by Hupbach, Gomez, Hardt, and Nadel (Learning &amp; Memory,
	14, 47 --53, 2007) and Hupbach, Gomez, and Nadel (Memory, 17, 502--510,
	2009) suggests that episodic m emory for a previously studied list
	can be updated to include new items, if participants are reminded
	of the earlier list just prior to learning a new list. The key finding
	from the Hupb ach studies was an asymmetric pattern of intrusions,
	whereby participants intruded numerous i tems from the second list
	when trying to recall the first list, but not viceversa. Hupbach
	et al. (2007; 2009) explained this pattern in terms of a cellular
	reconsolidation process, wher eby first-list memory is rendered labile
	by the reminder and the labile memory is then update d to include
	items from the second list. Here, we show that the temporal context
	model of mem ory, which lacks a cellular reconsolidation process,
	can account for the asymmetric intrusion effect, using well-established
	principles of contextual reinstatement and item--context bindi ng.},

	for a model c annot be mathematically specified, or has a complicated
	form. Although difficul ty in calculating a model's likelihood is
	extremely common, current {ABC} metho ds suffer from two problems
	that have largely prevented their mainstream adopti on: long computation
	time and an inability to scale beyond a few parameters. We introduce
	differential evolution as a computationally efficient genetic algori
	thm for proposal generation in our {ABC} sampler. We show how using
	this method allows our new {ABC} algorithm, called {ABCDE}, to obtain
	accurate posterior e stimates in fewer iterations than kernel-based
	{ABC} algorithms and to scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces
	that have proven difficult for current {ABC} methods.},
